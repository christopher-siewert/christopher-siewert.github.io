    "## Background Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Users on Deribit can trade in cryptocurrency derivates including options and futures. However, users are not able to buy or sell cryptocurrency on the platform. It doesn't accept traditional fiat currency; all deposits and withdrawals are done in crypto. Both the futures and options are cash-settled, simply transferring the profits and losses between the bitcoin accounts of the platform users. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, derivative prices are always based on an underlying asset price. The bitcoin futures and options at Deribit have payoffs based on the price of bitcoin in USD.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Deribit needs a way to track the fiat price of Bitcoin to determine the payoffs on options and futures. This brings us to our first important concept. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Deribit Bitcoin Index\n",
    "\n",
    "Deribit's Bitcoin index is **the** price of bitcoin by which all their derivatives profits are based on. It is an average of the current mid-price on 6 large cryptocurrency exchanges. Further information can be found [here](https://www.deribit.com/main#/indexes). Whenever I mention the *index* I mean this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Futures vs Perpetual Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Deribit sells two types of futures, regular and perpetual. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any listings with an expiry date are just typical futures contracts. The specification can be found [here](https://www.deribit.com/pages/docs/futures). Wiki and Investopedia can provide good explanations of how they work. When I refer to a *future* in this document, I mean a typical future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perpetual futures are very different and have unusual characteristics. We will discuss them in length in part 2. When I refer to a *perpetual*, I mean this special type of perpetual future. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Historical Future Price Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's download the data! Below is some python code that you can use to get all trade data for any instrument. I used this to get the sales price of every transaction for all Deribit futures in the last half of 2018 and 2019, which I will start exploring in part 2."
